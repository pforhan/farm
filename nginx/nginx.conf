# Nginx is no longer needed as Ktor will serve static files directly and handle requests.
# This file is retained as a placeholder but will not be used in the new docker-compose.yml.
# If a separate Nginx is desired for production (e.g., for SSL termination, load balancing),
# it would need to be re-introduced and configured to proxy to Ktor.
